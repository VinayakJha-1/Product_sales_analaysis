<h3> Market Research  </h3>
<p> Zee-5 offers a wide range of content including movies, TV shows, and original web series, and generates revenue through subscription fees and advertising. </p>
<ul>
<li> The Total Available Market (TAM) for Zee-5 is the total number of internet users in India, since Zee-5 is primarily targeted towards the Indian market.</li> <li>The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) would be a subset of the TAM, consisting of internet users who have access to digital entertainment platforms and are willing to pay for subscription services.</li>
<li>The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) consists of those who are actually using Zee-5's platform or have the potential to switch to it. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Heat Map </h3>
<p> By using the heatmap, we identified the areas companies are dedicating the most resources and attention, as well as any areas that may be underinvested or require additional attention. This help us to prioritize and ensure that they are focused on the areas that are most critical to their product's success. </p>

Overall, the ISPMA software product management heatmap helped us to gain insights into their product management activities and make data-driven decisions about where to focus their efforts.

<h3> BCG Matrix </h3>
<p> The BCG matrix was a tool used to analyze a company's product portfolio and identify which products are performing well and which ones need investment or divestment. 
	<li> <b>Question mark </b> - NFT, Metaverse, GPT tech-based stuff as a side revenue source: Zee innovationa and emerging technologies lab have the potential to create new revenue streams for Zee 5, but they are still in the early stages of development and market acceptance. Therefore, they are currently considered a question mark in the BCG matrix. </li>

<li> <b> Star </b>  - Sports which is growing OTT market: Sports is a popular category among viewers and has been growing rapidly in the OTT market. Zee 5 has already established a strong presence in this category with its live sports(2023 - T20 CUP) streaming and related content. </li>

<li> <b> Dogs </b> - Advertisement in Smart TV when compared with ZEE enterprise: Advertising on TV is a mature market with high competition, and Zee 5 is not a significant player in this category when compared to the overall Zee enterprise. Therefore, it can be considered a dog in the BCG matrix.

<li> <b> Cash cow  </b> - Subscription-based platform: Zee 5's primary revenue stream comes from its subscription-based platform, which has a loyal customer base and generates consistent revenue. Therefore, it can be considered a cash cow in the BCG matrix.
</ul>

<h3> Porter Five Forces </h3>
<p> Rivalry among competitors is high in industries such as OTT, TV, gaming, news, and sports, with companies differentiating themselves through original content, robust distribution channels, and brand value. The threat of new entrants is low due to barriers to entry such as oligopoly economies of scale, high capital requirements, and experience in the market. The bargaining power of buyers is high due to a large user base, high price sensitivity, and low switching costs. The threat of substitute products or services is also high with many close to 40 OTT options available, poor customer loyalty, and medium perceived production differentiation. The bargaining power of suppliers is high due to few suppliers with large or medium size and unique content and actor space, high prices, and high switching costs.</p>

<h1>Zee's Segmentation Strategy</h1>
	<h2>Creating robust user categories</h2>
	<p>We propose dividing Zee's user base into three categories:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Youth - Focused on series like Tripling, sports content, and small series that cater to the younger audience.</li>
		<li>Home - Targeted towards families who prefer watching popular Hindi movies, television shows, and a few new buzz movies such as Rocket Rashmi.</li>
		<li>Regional - Focused on daily soap operas and medium-sized blockbusters, catering to customers who prefer regional content.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This segmentation strategy will reduce acquisition costs from competition for Hollywood and new Bollywood movies and improve customer engagement and loyalty.</p>
	<h2>Strengthening early market niche</h2>
	<p>We have identified that Zee has now crossed the tornado stage of lifecycle and thus focusing on the early majority and channelizing content for a niche audience would be more effective. This approach will allow to better serve the needs of specific customer segments, attract new customers, and create a competitive advantage in the market. We recommend focusing on two specific product teams including user research and data analytics for further growth.</p>
	<h2>Pricing “For the user”</h2>
	<p>Niche can be priced separately. Youth can be provided with student discounts and language content can be improved and separately priced across regions to capitalize on the market share in regional spaces.</p>
	<h2>Flexible organizational structure</h2>
	<p>We recommend that Zee adopts a pod and tribe level organizational structure to increase agility, foster cross-functional collaboration, and promote innovation. This structure will reduce the current problems with the hierarchical structure and allow teams to work towards specific outcomes and goals.</p>
